ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bruno.


**Currently** <br/>
Working in the undersecretary of Education, Culture, Inclusion, Science and Technology. We work in the automation of processes, spreadsheets and the technology implementation in the Education as an whole. <br/>

**Already** <br/>
Used an wide range of technologies to create different kinds of applications, worked in gaming servers for plugins or rework.   

**LANGUAGES** <br/>
I belive I had used most langs out there, but we for sure have our preferences, and my preferences are the ones that gets the job done and can scale just as good. That means it *depends* on the project, but I'm used to projects using TypeScript, Java or Python.00

**SIMPLE BIO** <br/>
I belive I had an passion for technology since I first found it. Since then, I tried as much as possible to get more depht in the field. But I never had an computer of my own, was around 2021 that I bought one and started to learn programming right away. Found an really nice community on discord called [@TheDeveloperDen](https://github.com/TheDeveloperDen) and grew in there. They helped my not only in programming, but moral, ethic and english. Some time ago, I got into an uni and then got invited to work in the undersecretary due to my knowledge.
